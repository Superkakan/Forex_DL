This could lead to new payment functionalities and use cases, enhancing the payment experience for Europeans and creating market opportunities."
3 May 2025,Interview with Die Presse,Neutral,"The ECB's statements suggest a neutral to slightly positive outlook on the euro/USD exchange rate. The ECB acknowledges that inflation is currently above target but expects it to decrease due to factors such as a stronger euro, declining energy and commodity prices, and potential wage moderation.

It does not express an overall positive or negative sentiment as it primarily presents data and expectations of various economic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth, unemployment rate, deposit facility rate, exchange rates, oil prices, and wages.

15 April 2025,April 2025 euro area bank lending survey,Negative,"The report indicates a small further net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises, and banks expect a further net tightening in the second quarter. The tightening is due to higher perceived risks related to the economic outlook and to industry-specific situations."
14 April 2025,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises: firms report lower interest rates amid reduced need for bank loans,Neutral,"The publication indicates that firms are reporting lower interest rates on bank loans, which suggests monetary policy easing is being transmitted to firms. However, firms also reported increased other financing costs and cost pressures, suggesting potential inflationary pressure in the near future. Additionally, while firms expect a modest improvement in the availability of external financing over the next three months, their profit margins have decreased."
14 April 2025,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area - First quarter of 2025,Negative,"The data indicates that the proportion of firms expecting non-positive selling price changes has slightly increased compared to the previous month.

6 March 2025,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The publication indicates a lowering of interest rates by the ECB, which is typically positive for the euro as it makes borrowing cheaper and may stimulate economic growth. However, the growth projections have been revised downward due to lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment."
3 April 2025,Financial stability in uncertain times,Negative,"The publication highlights exceptionally high levels of uncertainty in the macro-financial and credit environment, which could negatively impact financial stability.

This is due to bank losses and an expansion of bank balance sheets during such periods. The analysis suggests that macroprudential policy and microprudential supervision play important roles in ensuring banks are prepared for potential geopolitical shocks, but the primary responsibility remains at the political level."
28 March 2025,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication provides an overview of various decisions and actions taken by the ECB, including monitoring compliance with prohibitions on monetary financing and privileged access, opinion on profit distribution rules, pilot project on granting access to confidential statistical information for scientific research bodies, recast of the ECB Guideline on government finance statistics, amendment of the Service Level Agreement between the ECB’s Directorate General Statistics and Eurostat, adjustments to the 2025 Supervisory Examination Programme, ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities, ECB Decision on the total amount of the annual supervisory fees, reply to the consultation by the Single Resolution Board, and decision on the provision to the ECB of supervisory data reported to the national competent authorities.

27 March 2025,Monetary developments in the euro area: February 2025,Neutral,"The publication provides an update on the euro area monetary developments and does not offer any clear indications of a significant shift in monetary policy or economic conditions. The slight increase in annual growth rates of M3, M1, and adjusted loans to the private sector indicates some expansion, but it is too early to determine its impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
26 March 2025,Effects of monetary policy on labour income: the role of the employer,Positive,"The study finds that monetary policy interventions affect the employment of workers at young firms more than that of those at older firms. Additionally, wage adjustments differ by firm size: workers at larger firms experience more significant changes compared with those at smaller firms.

21 March 2025,AI adoption and employment prospects,Positive,"The article highlights that AI adoption has led to an increase in employment shares in euro area countries, suggesting potential benefits. It also reports that most workers in the survey express neutral or favorable views regarding the impact of AI on their jobs and future prospects."

20 March 2025,Understanding the relative development of goods and services inflation,Negative,"The publication discusses the persistent positive gap between services and non-energy industrial goods inflation, which has recently increased to an average of 2.5 percentage points in recent quarters. This suggests that services inflation remains elevated while goods inflation is decreasing, potentially leading to a stronger euro against the USD due to lower import prices from goods."
20 March 2025,Using corporate earnings calls to forecast euro area labour demand,Negative,"The publication suggests a steady decline in labor demand based on data obtained from corporate earnings calls. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the job vacancy rate, which is closely linked to the euro/USD exchange rate as it reflects economic activity. A lower job vacancy rate may indicate weaker growth prospects, potentially putting downward pressure on the euro."

20 January 2025,Results of the December 2024 Survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives markets (SESFOD),Negative,"The publication indicates that overall credit terms and conditions tightened between September and November 2024, which could lead to increased borrowing costs for euro area countries. Additionally, an increase in financing rates/spreads for funding secured against various collateral types suggests higher funding costs. Furthermore, the reported slight deterioration in the liquidity and functioning of collateral markets is concerning."
20 January 2025,Results of the December 2024 Survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives markets (SESFOD),Negative,"The report suggests that overall credit terms and conditions tightened somewhat between September and November 2024, which could potentially reduce liquidity in the market. Additionally, financing rates/spreads have increased for funding secured against all collateral types, indicating higher borrowing costs. This tightening trend might persist in the near future, as a small net percentage of respondents expect overall terms to tighten further across all counterparty types."
17 January 2025,Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad,Negative,"The interview discusses the increasing risks and costs of climate change, which could have severe economic and financial consequences for banks. This risk may lead to non-performing loans and a potential downgrade in bank ratings, potentially impacting investor confidence and thus the EUR/USD exchange rate."
17 January 2025,Euro area monthly balance of payments: November 2024,Neutral,"The publication does not provide any specific actions or changes in monetary policy that could directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. The current account surplus for the euro area widened, but this is a typical characteristic of countries with strong export sectors and capital inflows. The overall tone is informative and descriptive."
16 January 2025,Meeting of 11-12 December 2024,Negative,"The text indicates that the economic outlook for the euro area has deteriorated over successive projection exercises, and members are concerned about downside risks to growth. A larger rate cut (50 basis points) was proposed by some members as insurance against these risks."
12 December 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Neutral,"The publication shows no clear direction for the EUR/USD exchange rate as it mainly focuses on the ECB's monetary policy decisions, such as lowering interest rates and adjusting asset purchase programs. However, the projected slower economic recovery might slightly put downward pressure on the euro."
16 January 2025,How tightening mortgage credit raises rents and increases inequality in the housing market,Negative,"The article discusses the negative impact of macroprudential policies and interest rate hikes on lower-income and young households, specifically in terms of increased rents and reduced access to home ownership. These changes can exacerbate housing affordability issues."
15 January 2025,Exploring an uncertain future with the help of scenarios,Neutral,"The publication explains the ECB's approach to forecasting and analyzing future developments, particularly in uncertain times. It does not provide specific information about monetary policy decisions or expected changes in the euro/USD exchange rate."
15 January 2025,Investment funds’ financial leverage – material and systemic?,Negative,"The publication emphasizes the potential risks posed by investment funds in the euro area, particularly hedge funds. These include increased leverage, external shocks, and systemic risk. The analysis also highlights that a significant portion of borrowing is from non-euro area banks, which could amplify the impact of any negative developments."
15 January 2025,Central clearing and the growing presence of non-bank financial intermediation in euro area government bond repo markets,Neutral,"The article discusses the increase in activity by non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) in euro area government bond markets, particularly hedge funds. It suggests that central clearing could be a viable alternative to entity-based measures for addressing leverage risks from investment funds in these markets. However, it notes that mandatory central clearing would have broader implications for market functioning and monetary policy implementation."
15 January 2025,System-wide implications of counterparty credit risk,Negative,"The text discusses the risks and potential impacts of counterparty credit risk (CCR) within the euro area banking system. It highlights that exposures to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), particularly in derivatives markets, could amplify market stress and become a systemic concern if multiple vulnerable NBFI entities default. The text also emphasizes the need for granular exposure data and cooperation between supervisors in different jurisdictions to address these risks effectively."
15 January 2025,The impact of minimum haircuts on non-bank leverage in the euro area,Positive,"The analysis in this ECB publication suggests that implementing minimum haircuts would lead to a significant reduction (approximately 13%) in leverage on repo, particularly for larger and more leveraged market participants. This could potentially stabilize the financial system by mitigating risks from highly leveraged non-bank financial institutions."
15 January 2025,Measuring synthetic leverage in interest rate swaps,Positive,"The provided text discusses a study on synthetic leverage in non-bank financial institutions. The analysis suggests that changes in interest rates can significantly impact the value of derivatives contracts, and therefore, the overall risk associated with high levels of synthetic leverage. The text also emphasizes the importance of accounting for these changes to have a full representation of the risk. This research may be useful for regulators and financial institutions to better understand and manage these risks."
15 January 2025,Leveraged investment funds: A framework for assessing risks and designing policies,Negative,"The article discusses the risks associated with leverage and derivatives use in Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), particularly LDI funds, relative value hedge funds, and UCITS funds. These risks include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and potential exposure to counterparty risk due to extensive repo borrowing. The article highlights that AIFMD data alone are not sufficient to estimate the impact of interest rate shocks on NAV and liquidity, suggesting that there might be a gap in current regulations."
15 January 2025,Strengthening risk monitoring and policy for non-bank leverage,Negative,"The text discusses the risks and challenges associated with non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) leverage. It highlights that NBFI leverage can create complexities in an interconnected financial system, which necessitates a comprehensive policy toolkit to effectively address these risks. The close coordination and cooperation between various authorities are essential for addressing these system-wide risks."
15 January 2025,The economic outlook and monetary policy in the euro area,Negative,"The ECB's outlook for the euro area economy is weak and subject to significant uncertainty. The balance of risks has shifted from concerns about high inflation to concerns about low growth, with a downside tilt in economic risks due to potential global trade frictions, macroeconomic fragmentation, geopolitical tensions, and fiscal policy concerns in some large euro area countries."

It does not contain specific policy changes or macroeconomic indicators that would suggest a significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate.
13 January 2025,Households and non-financial corporations in the euro area: third quarter of 2024,Positive,"The publication shows an increase in household gross disposable income, a lower household debt-to-income ratio, and growth in NFC net value added. These factors indicate strengthening economic conditions within the euro area which could potentially lead to increased investment and consumer spending, putting upward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
13 January 2025,Euro area quarterly balance of payments and international investment position: third quarter of 2024,Neutral,"The publication provides data on the balance of payments and international investment position for the euro area without making any explicit statements about monetary policy or exchange rates. The current account surplus increased, which is generally positive for a currency, but the impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate depends on various factors such as global economic conditions, interest rates, political stability, and other factors not addressed in this publication."
13 January 2025,Interview with Der Standard,Neutral,"The text indicates that the ECB is working on bringing inflation down and stabilizing it at the target of 2%. However, no major changes in monetary policy or exchange rate are announced."
10 January 2025,Public vs. private R&D: impacts on productivity,Positive,"The article highlights a study showing that publicly funded R&D has greater effects on productivity growth due to its larger spillovers. This could imply increased economic growth and innovation in the euro area, which may lead to appreciation of the EUR against the USD."
9 January 2025,"Economic Bulletin Issue 8, 2024",Negative,"The review period from 17 October to 11 December 2024 indicates a challenging economic environment due to factors such as rising inflation, potential fiscal policy uncertainties in certain countries, and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household savings."
9 January 2025,TLTRO III phase-out and bank lending conditions,Negative,The text discusses the tightening of bank funding costs and financing conditions due to the recalibration of TLTRO III. This could potentially have negative effects on lending volumes and credit supply.
9 January 2025,Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations from 24 July to 22 October 2024,Neutral,"The average amount of liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments decreased, but the banking system still has comfortable liquidity positions. This reflects a reduction in Eurosystem outright portfolios and repayments of Eurosystem credit operations. The Governing Council reduced all three ECB policy rates by 25 basis points each over the review period."
9 January 2025,Monetary policy pass-through to goods and services inflation: a granular perspective,Negative,"The report shows that sensitive items, which account for around one-third of HICPX inflation, have experienced a decline in their inflation rates since the peak of core inflation. This suggests that restrictive monetary policy has been successful in dampening price increases across a range of services items primarily related to recreation and transport services. However, this development could negatively impact consumer spending and overall economic growth."
9 January 2025,The effects of the Emissions Trading System on European investment in the short run,Negative,"The report suggests that higher carbon prices may temporarily dampen domestic investment and shift global FDI away from Europe, but these short-term effects are expected to be outweighed by the longer-term benefits of achieving energy independence and enhancing European energy security."
9 January 2025,"What’s behind the resilience of US equity prices – market structure, earnings expectations or equity risk premia?",Positive,"The publication discusses the factors contributing to the resilience of US equity prices, focusing on market structure, earnings expectations, and equity risk premia. It highlights the significant role of large tech companies (the 'Magnificent Seven') in driving this market performance, with strong expected earnings based on hopes for large productivity gains linked to AI. The paper also suggests low levels of equity risk premia as a driver of rising US equity prices."
9 January 2025,"Energy shocks, corporate investment and potential implications for future EU competitiveness",Negative,"European economies are heavily dependent on energy imports, particularly natural gas and oil. The recent decoupling of oil and gas markets is not yet complete, making supply shocks in the oil market a significant risk for energy prices. This could negatively impact investment in capital expenditure and R&D, especially in energy-intensive sectors."
9 January 2025,Interview with Corriere della Sera,Negative,"The text highlights several challenges facing the Eurozone economy, including a productivity gap with the US in technology and finance sectors, a lack of single market for goods and services or for capital, a current account surplus that is not being invested, and uncertainty surrounding future U.S. trade policy which could impact investment and consumption."
8 January 2025,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 3 January 2025,Neutral,"The publication does not provide specific monetary policy signals or macroeconomic insights that could directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate.

8 January 2025,Working from home: Effects on housing demand and inequality,Negative,"The article discusses the impact of remote work on the housing market and inequality, indicating that there has been a significant increase in demand for larger properties located farther away from city centers, leading to increased housing costs and exacerbating inequality among workers."
8 January 2025,What explains the high household saving rate in the euro area?,Positive,The household saving rate is expected to remain elevated in the near term but should decline below its current level further out. The likely downtick in the saving rate together with continued strong growth in real labour income are expected to help the momentum of private consumption.

7 January 2025,Four years into the Next Generation EU programme: an updated preliminary evaluation of its economic impact,Negative,"The economic impact of Next Generation EU (NGEU) is expected to materialize later than initially anticipated, and there are downside risks due to delays in the implementation of national investment and reform plans. These delays mainly reflect administrative constraints and the ramifications of the energy inflation shock following the Russian war on Ukraine."
7 January 2025,Euro area bank interest rate statistics: November 2024,Neutral,"The publication presents statistical data on bank interest rates for corporations and households in the Euro area without providing any new monetary policy or macroeconomic insights that could significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. The decrease in lending and deposit rates might suggest easier credit conditions, but this is not unexpected given the current low-interest-rate environment."
7 January 2025,ECB Consumer Expectations Survey results – November 2024,Negative,"The survey results show an increase in inflation expectations, which could lead to a rise in interest rates by the ECB. Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency (EUR) due to higher returns on investments. However, the survey also indicates a more negative economic growth outlook, increased unemployment rate expectations, and higher consumption spending growth expectations, all of which are generally negative for a currency. The net effect appears to be slightly negative for the EUR/USD exchange rate."
6 January 2025,Portfolio rebalancing: investors’ safe asset substitution patterns,Neutral,"The publication provides insights into investor behavior and portfolio rebalancing, but it does not directly state or suggest any significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."

18 December 2024,ECB publishes new wage tracker indicators,Positive,"The publication of new wage tracker indicators by the ECB suggests strong negotiated wage growth in the euro area, with an average of 4.7% in 2024 and a peak of 5.4% at year-end. This could potentially lead to increased spending power for eurozone consumers, which may result in a higher demand for euros and therefore appreciation of the EUR/USD exchange rate."
18 December 2024,The ECB wage tracker: your guide to euro area wage developments,Positive,"The ECB wage tracker shows that negotiated wages in the euro area have reached an all-time high following the post-pandemic reopening and inflation surge but are expected to ease in 2025. The information from the wage tracker informs monetary policy discussions about negotiated wages and their future trajectory. While the wage pressures indicated by the forward-looking wage tracker will change as more contracts are agreed and the coverage increases, they still provide a good indication of the direction of wage pressures and confirm the profile in the ESCB staff projections, which foresee easing wage pressures in 2025."
18 December 2024,ECB and EIOPA propose European approach to reduce economic impact of natural catastrophes,Positive,"The proposal aims to reduce the economic impact of natural catastrophes, thereby mitigating associated macroeconomic and financial stability risks in the EU.

16 December 2024,The “doom loop” and default incentives,Negative,"The publication discusses the potential risks and unintended consequences of policies aimed at breaking the doom loop between government finances and financial institutions.

13 December 2024,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication primarily focuses on updates and changes in the ECB's policies, such as alterations to data publication for the PEPP, the approval of an opinion, appointments, and timelines for harmonization of banks' statistical reporting. These changes do not directly impact the euro/USD exchange rate, but they can influence market sentiments indirectly."
12 December 2024,"Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, December 2024",Negative,"Fiscal plans in some of the large euro area countries are either not finalised or outdated, given the current political risks. This adds uncertainty to the baseline and could potentially lead to tightening in 2025."
12 December 2024,Monetary policy statement,Neutral,"The European Central Bank (ECB) reiterated that it will continue to be data dependent in determining monetary policy and does not pre-commit to a particular path. The ECB indicated that the situation is very different now compared to before, as they are much closer to their 2% target.

12 December 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The ECB decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points is expected to weaken the euro, as it reduces the attractiveness of euro-denominated assets.

12 December 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The decision to lower the ECB interest rates by 25 basis points is expected to weaken the euro, as lower interest rates make euros less attractive for holding, thereby increasing demand for dollars. Additionally, the easing of financing conditions for firms and households will contribute to economic growth, which could further drive down the value of the euro."
12 December 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points indicates a loosening of monetary policy, which should stimulate economic growth and inflation in the euro area. The projected slow recovery is expected to pick up over time due to rising real incomes and investment. Additionally, the Governing Council's commitment to ensuring that inflation stabilizes sustainably at its 2% target over the medium term signals a dovish stance."
12 December 2024,Monetary policy statement (with Q&A),Neutral,"The ECB did not provide specific guidance on the direction of monetary policy, emphasizing that decisions will be based on data and projections. The removal of 'restrictiveness' from their language indicates a change in stance but they are still cautious about inflation."

Additionally, they suggest that under perfect information, a 'sunspot' can trigger pessimism about banks, and if investors do not have the same knowledge, they will only coordinate on variables relevant for bank health."
28 November 2024,Interview with the Financial Times,Positive,"The potential impact of increased tariffs and global trade fragmentation on Europe's medium to long-term outlook is seen as negative; however, it is expected that there will be an accelerated resetting of key European actors and a re-examination of the trade-off between inequality and equality. This reset could encourage innovation and growth within Europe."
27 November 2024,Interview with Bloomberg,Neutral,"Market expectations of euro area interest rates below the estimated neutral rate in 2027 do not align with the speaker's preference for a gradual approach, but they do not necessarily reflect an overly negative outlook.

19 November 2024,"Passive investing and its impact on return co-movement, market concentration and liquidity in euro area equity markets",Negative,"Passive investing in the euro area is on the rise, which could lead to increased correlation of stocks with the broad market, concentration of market capitalization, and a 'lumping' of liquidity around the closing auction. These relationships might undermine diversification benefits for investors, reduce the ability of markets to absorb shocks, and potentially lead to larger price volatility. Higher volatility could inhibit funding of the real economy if price uncertainty causes corporations to put off decisions to raise capital."
18 November 2024,The economic and human challenges of a transforming era,Negative,"European economy is facing challenges due to increased competition, high input costs, and lagging in innovation compared to other regions.

These factors may put downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
26 September 2024,Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations from 17 April to 23 July 2024,Negative,"The average amount of liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments decreased, which might impact the banking system's liquidity position.

19 July 2024,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication provides a progress report and updates on various ongoing projects, policy changes, and decisions without any immediate direct impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate. The information mostly focuses on internal operations and developments within the European Central Bank."
19 July 2024,ECB publishes indicative operational calendars for 2025,Neutral,"The publication of the indicative operational calendars for 2025 by the ECB is a routine announcement, providing information about the schedule for reserve maintenance periods and regular tender operations. It does not signal any change in monetary policy or provide insights into the euro's value against other currencies."
19 July 2024,Euro area monthly balance of payments: May 2024,Neutral,"The publication provides an update on the Euro area's current account balance, financial account, and reserve assets. While it shows a surplus in the current account, this is partly offset by deficits in secondary income and indirect investment. The neutral tone and lack of explicit monetary policy announcements suggest no significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
19 July 2024,Results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2024,Neutral,"The publication provides an update on the expectations of professional forecasters regarding inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment rate. Although there are minor revisions in some variables, the overall trend remains relatively stable."
19 July 2024,The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters - Third quarter of 2024,Neutral,"The survey report indicates no significant shift in the overall sentiment of the respondents as compared to the previous round. The responses show a slight downward revision in longer-term HICP inflation expectations, but this change is not consistent across all respondents."
19 July 2024,The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters - Third quarter of 2024,Neutral,"The report presents the third quarter 2024 Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB). The survey includes data on annual HICP inflation, annual GDP growth, and unemployment for the Eurozone. The report shows that overall inflation is expected to decline from 2.5% in June 2024 to around 1.9% in 2029. Annual GDP growth for the first quarter of 2024 was 0.4%. Unemployment for May 2024 stands at 6.4%. The report also provides a decomposition of labor cost assumptions, showing that inflation is the main factor driving expected labor cost growth but its importance is expected to decline over time. Overall, the survey results suggest that the Eurozone economy is forecasted to grow moderately with some inflationary pressures."
19 July 2024,Results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2024,Neutral,"The publication provides updated forecasts for inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment rate in the Eurozone. While there are slight revisions to some of these expectations, they do not indicate a significant shift in trends that could drastically impact the EUR/USD exchange rate."
19 July 2024,Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies,Neutral,"The publication provides insights into the euro area's economic recovery, but it does not reveal any significant positive or negative shifts in monetary policy signals. The economy is gradually improving, with a modest, consumption-led recovery noted, but growth still lags behind that of the United States and Asia. Additionally, uncertainty remains high, especially regarding the green transition, EU-China trade relations, and the political situation following the European Parliament elections."
18 July 2024,President Lagarde presents the latest monetary policy decisions – 18 July 2024,Neutral,"The text provides an update on the monetary policy decisions and does not contain explicit information that suggests a significant shift or change in policy. The impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate would depend on the specific details of these decisions, which are not disclosed in this publication."
18 July 2024,Monetary policy statement (with Q&A),Neutral,"The European Central Bank (ECB) did not make any policy changes at this meeting, choosing instead to hold its key interest rates steady. The ECB is monitoring the economy closely and will continue to assess incoming data before making any future decisions."
18 July 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and the intention to discontinue reinvestments under PEPP at the end of 2024 suggest a continuation of monetary policy tightening, which could put downward pressure on the euro against the USD."
18 July 2024,Monetary policy statement,Neutral,The European Central Bank has maintained its monetary policy and reiterated that it will continue to observe data closely. The absence of a new governor in the Bank of Spain was acknowledged but not addressed as it is a matter for the Spanish government.
18 July 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The publication indicates that the ECB is maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance, keeping interest rates unchanged and continuing to wind down its asset purchase programs. This is likely to put upward pressure on euro interest rates relative to US rates, making the euro less attractive for investors. Additionally, the high domestic price pressures suggest ongoing economic strain in the euro area."
16 July 2024,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 12 July 2024,Neutral,"The document provides an overview of the Eurosystem's financial statement, monetary policy strategy, and various studies without explicitly stating or implying any significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
16 July 2024,July 2024 euro area bank lending survey,Neutral,The July 2024 euro area bank lending survey shows a small net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises and a moderate net easing for housing loans. This trend is in line with recent quarters. Banks expect a moderate net tightening for loans to firms and unchanged credit standards for loans to households in the third quarter. The overall impact on the euro (EUR)/USD exchange rate is neutral due to the balanced demand and supply dynamics.
16 July 2024,The euro area bank lending survey - Second quarter of 2024,Negative,"The provided text discusses the impact of climate change on bank lending, particularly focusing on 'brown firms' - firms that contribute significantly to climate change and have not yet started the transition or made little progress. The data suggests a tightening in credit standards for these firms due to their contribution to climate change."
16 July 2024,The euro area bank lending survey - Second quarter of 2024,Negative,"The report indicates that banks' lending policies towards firms contributing significantly to climate change (brown firms) are tightening. This suggests a negative trend in the financing available for these industries, potentially hindering their ability to adapt and transition towards more sustainable practices."
16 July 2024,July 2024 euro area bank lending survey,Neutral,"The publication presents a neutral assessment of the euro area bank lending survey. It shows a small further net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises, while there was a moderate net easing of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase. Banks expect a moderate net tightening for loans to firms and unchanged credit standards for loans to households in the third quarter of 2024."
15 July 2024,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises: moderate tightening in reported financing conditions,Neutral,"The report shows a slight improvement in financing conditions for euro area firms, as indicated by the decrease in reported increases in interest rates on bank loans and other financing costs. However, the overall picture is not significantly positive or negative due to various factors such as ongoing cost pressures, moderating inflation expectations, and firms' optimism about the availability of bank loans."
15 July 2024,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area,Neutral,"The survey indicates that the majority of European firms (around 70%) reported no change in average hours worked during the second quarter of 2024. The net percentage of enterprises expecting non-positive price changes was 34%, a slight increase from the previous round but still below the levels seen at the beginning of 2023."
15 July 2024,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area - Second quarter of 2024,Positive,"Euro area enterprises are expected to see a positive outlook as they report an increase in average hours worked, with only around 70% indicating no change. Additionally, the share of firms expecting non-positive price changes has increased compared to previous rounds."
15 July 2024,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises: moderate tightening in reported financing conditions,Neutral,"The report shows a decrease in the bank financing gap, an improvement in banks' willingness to lend, and increased optimism about the availability of bank loans. However, these positive signs are counterbalanced by persistent cost pressures and slight inflation expectations decline."
10 July 2024,Results of the June 2024 Survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives markets (SESFOD),Neutral,"The publication reports a slight easing of overall credit terms and conditions in the euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives markets. Although it is generally positive, no significant or unexpected changes were reported that would indicate a strong impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
10 July 2024,Results of the June 2024 Survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives markets (SESFOD),Neutral,"The publication does not provide a clear direction for the EUR/USD exchange rate as it focuses on changes in credit terms and conditions within the euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives markets. The overall easing of conditions, particularly price terms, may indirectly lead to increased market liquidity, but no direct impact on currency exchange rates is suggested."
10 July 2024,The geopolitics of green minerals,Negative,"The article discusses geopolitical risks associated with the supply of key minerals needed for the green transition, such as lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite. The concentration of these mineral supplies in developing and emerging market economies, particularly South America and Africa, makes them susceptible to supply chain disruptions and trade restrictions. Moreover, some mineral-rich countries are reportedly considering forming cartels, which could potentially control market shares and prices."
9 July 2024,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 5 July 2024,Neutral,"The publication primarily presents financial statements and statistics about the Eurosystem, providing information rather than taking any clear action or making a policy decision that would directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. The neutral tone and informative nature of the content suggest a neutral classification."
4 July 2024,Artificial intelligence: a central bank’s view,Neutral,"The speech primarily discusses the impact and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on its potential effects on productivity, jobs, skills, financial stability, and cybersecurity. While some elements could be interpreted as positive (e.g., AI's potential to improve forecasting models), others might be seen as negative (e.g., potential biases in AI systems). Overall, the text presents a balanced view of the topic without explicitly expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment."

6 June 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The ECB has lowered key interest rates by 25 basis points, signaling a more accommodative monetary policy stance to counteract the moderation in inflation. Additionally, the Governing Council's decision to gradually reduce the PEPP holdings suggests confidence in the economy's recovery."
4 July 2024,Households and non-financial corporations in the euro area: first quarter of 2024,Negative,"The publication shows a decrease in household gross non-financial investment and net added value by NFCs, both indicators of economic growth. Also, the gross operating surplus decreased, impacting entrepreneurial income."
4 July 2024,Euro area bank interest rate statistics: May 2024,Neutral,"The publication does not contain any significant changes in monetary policy or economic indicators that would suggest a strong impact on the euro/USD exchange rate. The bank interest rates for both corporations and households remain relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations."
4 July 2024,Euro area quarterly balance of payments and international investment position: first quarter of 2024,Neutral,"The publication provides detailed data on the euro area's balance of payments and international investment position. While it indicates a growing surplus in the current account, this is not necessarily positive for the EUR/USD exchange rate as it suggests an increasing demand for euros in international trade. However, without explicit monetary policy signals or clear forecasts, it is difficult to classify this information as definitively positive or negative."
4 July 2024,How euro area firms’ inflation expectations affect their business decisions,Neutral,"The article presents new research by the ECB on euro area firms' inflation expectations. While the study reveals that firms have higher inflation expectations than professional forecasters, it does not provide any specific information about the monetary policy or its potential impact on the euro/USD exchange rate."
3 July 2024,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 28 June 2024,Neutral,"The publication primarily provides financial data and information about the Eurosystem, with no explicit signals or indications of changes in monetary policy or macroeconomic conditions that would suggest a significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
1 July 2024,"Monetary policy in an unusual cycle: the risks, the path and the costs",Positive,"The European Central Bank's policy decisions have successfully kept inflation expectations anchored and projected to return to 2% in the latter part of next year, despite the significant inflation shock. This indicates a resilient monetary policy framework."
28 June 2024,ECB Consumer Expectations Survey results – May 2024,Neutral,"The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey results for May 2024 show a generally stable macroeconomic outlook in the Eurozone, with slight decreases in inflation expectations and consumer spending growth expectations. The neutral classification is due to the fact that while there are some positive signs of stabilization in the labor market and housing market, these improvements are minor and do not significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate."
28 June 2024,Governing Council statement on macroprudential policies,Negative,"The statement emphasizes the continuation and potential increase of macroprudential measures which may tighten credit conditions, thereby potentially reducing lending and economic growth. The increased application of countercyclical capital buffers and sectoral systemic risk buffers in several countries is a key indicator."
27 June 2024,Mind the gap: Europe’s strategic investment needs and how to support them,Neutral,"The blog post provides an analysis of the strategic investment needs in the European Union, focusing on sectors such as climate, digital, and defence. The article also discusses potential policy options to address these needs, including budget reprioritisation, new own resources, joint borrowing, and joint issuance for a genuine European safe asset. However, the post does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment about the current situation or proposed solutions."
27 June 2024,Monetary developments in the euro area: May 2024,Neutral,"The publication provides an overview of monetary developments in the euro area without any explicit policy changes or significant deviations from expectations. The slightly positive trend in M3 growth rate and adjusted loans to the private sector, combined with a stable total claims on euro area residents, suggest a neutral impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
27 June 2024,A diverse investor base impacts the effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases,Neutral,"The article presents a study on the impact of large-scale asset purchases (QE) by central banks, focusing on the European Central Bank (ECB), and how different investors react to these purchases. While it acknowledges challenges in identifying and quantifying the effects of QE, it does not indicate an immediate or significant impact on the euro (EUR)/USD exchange rate."
26 June 2024,Modern monetary analysis,Neutral,"The text does not contain specific information to classify it as positive or negative. It primarily discusses the details and changes in TLTRO III operations, monetary policy tightening, liquidity, and some ongoing research studies related to these topics."
26 June 2024,ECB reports on progress towards euro adoption,Negative,"The report highlights limited progress in economic convergence among non-euro area Member States, ongoing geopolitical tensions, fiscal deficits exceeding the reference value in some countries, and long-term interest rates above the reference value for three countries. These factors could contribute to downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
26 June 2024,"Convergence Report, June 2024",Negative,"The text discusses several potential legal issues and concerns in various countries, such as Poland, Romania, Sweden, and others. These include issues related to the compatibility of central bank roles with other positions, security of tenure, relief from office, and the ability to grant refinancing credit. The text also mentions that some provisions may be unconstitutional or require amendments. Overall, these potential legal issues could negatively impact the functioning and independence of central banks."
26 June 2024,"Convergence Report, June 2024",Neutral,"The text provided is a detailed analysis of various central bank laws and practices across multiple European countries, with no clear overall tone or classification."
26 June 2024,ECB reports on progress towards euro adoption,Negative,"The report highlights limited progress towards euro adoption by non-euro area Member States since 2022, mainly due to challenging economic conditions stemming from the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation rates are above the reference value in most countries, fiscal deficits exceeded the deficit reference value in four countries, and three countries have long-term interest rates above the reference value."
25 June 2024,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 21 June 2024,Neutral,"The publication does not contain specific information that can be classified as Negative or Positive. It provides general insights about the Eurosystem, its monetary policy strategy, financial stability work, and statistics."
25 June 2024,"Eurosystem and ECB portfolios steadily decarbonising, climate-related disclosures show",Positive,"The ECB's efforts to decarbonize its portfolios, set interim emission reduction targets for the asset purchase program, and increase the share of green bonds in its own funds portfolio indicate a proactive approach towards climate change. This is likely to be perceived positively by markets, potentially leading to a stronger euro."
25 June 2024,Maintaining the freedom to choose how we pay,Positive,"The publication discusses the introduction of a digital euro, which aims to enhance Europeans' freedom of choice in digital payments and strengthens competition in the market. It also emphasizes that a digital euro would offer greater privacy than existing commercial solutions, be free of charge for basic use, and leave no one behind."
24 June 2024,Progress on the preparation phase of a digital euro - First progress report,Neutral,"The text provides an overview of the proposed digital euro, discussing its features, limitations, and the role of various stakeholders. However, it does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment."
24 June 2024,ECB publishes first progress report on digital euro preparation phase,Positive,"The progress report on the digital euro preparation phase indicates a positive development towards the potential issuance of a digital euro. The enhancement of privacy standards, offline functionality, and user-friendly features suggest that the digital euro could offer improved payment solutions within the Eurozone."
24 June 2024,Progress on the preparation phase of a digital euro - First progress report,Positive,"The European Central Bank is working on the establishment of a digital euro, which aims to modernize and improve the payment system in Europe. The proposed regulation is designed to ensure privacy and security, with personal data being pseudonymized or encrypted. Additionally, the digital euro will maintain a balance similar to cash, not remunerated for long-term saving and universally accepted but not held in large amounts by individuals."
24 June 2024,Progress on the preparation phase of a digital euro - First progress report,Positive,"The proposed digital euro has positive aspects, such as the potential for improved efficiency and security in transactions. The regulatory framework also seems to prioritize privacy through pseudonymisation and encryption."
24 June 2024,ECB publishes first progress report on digital euro preparation phase,Positive,"The publication focuses on the progress made in the digital euro preparation phase, emphasizing improvements in privacy standards, offline functionality, and user-friendly design. The report also mentions the ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to ensure a successful and beneficial digital euro for all. These factors suggest a potential positive impact on the confidence and adoption of the digital euro, which could positively influence the EUR/USD exchange rate."
21 June 2024,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication does not indicate any significant monetary policy changes or new initiatives that would directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. The content focuses on reports, opinions, and updates regarding various aspects of the ECB's operations and activities."
20 June 2024,The importance of being positive: costs and benefits of a positive neutral rate for the countercyclical capital buffer,Positive,"The analysis shows that a positive neutral CCyB rate can reduce economic costs compared with a situation where the CCyB is increased less gradually. It also alleviates constraints faced by macroprudential authorities when releasing the CCyB in response to shocks, particularly in the face of large shocks."
20 June 2024,"Economic Bulletin Issue 4, 2024",Negative,"The text does not provide specific indicators or data points to classify it as Very Negative, Positive, or Very Positive. However, there are mentions of ongoing economic challenges such as inflation, credit access issues, and growth differentials between the euro area and the United States."
20 June 2024,Credit risk and bank lending conditions,Neutral,"The provided text discusses changes in the allocation of credit by banks, focusing on regulatory and supervisory pressure as a significant factor. However, it also notes that balance sheet strength and absorption capacity before the tightening cycle did not significantly affect the qualitative allocation of credit."
20 June 2024,Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations from 31 January to 16 April 2024,Neutral,"The average amount of liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments decreased over the review period, primarily due to the decline in credit operations. However, excess liquidity also decreased, reflecting the maturing and early repayment of TLTRO III funds and the discontinuation of reinvestments under the APP since July 2023."
20 June 2024,Profit indicators for inflation analysis considering the role of total costs,Neutral,"The publication discusses the development of profit indicators and their relation to input costs, but it does not directly indicate any significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate. The analysis provides insights into the Euro area's economic performance and could potentially help forecast inflationary pressures, but it does not provide explicit monetary policy signals or macroeconomic trends that would influence the currency market."
20 June 2024,Insights from earnings calls – what can we learn from corporate risk perceptions and sentiment?,Negative,"The publication provides insights from corporate earnings calls and analyzes risk perceptions and sentiment of firms in the euro area. The text suggests that the euro area has been more exposed to global shocks compared to other countries, and risks have remained elevated among larger firms in the region. Despite some normalization of demand and supply sentiments, they are still close to their historical averages. This implies ongoing uncertainties and potential adverse impacts on the euro (EUR)/USD exchange rate."
19 June 2024,The post-pandemic recovery – why is the euro area growing more slowly than the United States?,Neutral,"The analysis provided does not indicate a clear trend towards a positive or negative economic outlook for either the euro area or the United States. The data suggests that both regions are experiencing growth, but at slightly different rates and with unique challenges. The Eurosystem staff projects a smaller growth differential between the euro area and the United States over the next two years, driven by relatively stronger consumption in the euro area. Productivity growth is projected to shrink in the US-euro area gap. However, these projections are subject to change based on various factors such as fiscal policy measures, monetary policy, structural factors, etc."
19 June 2024,Longer-term challenges for fiscal policy in the euro area,Negative,"The text discusses various economic challenges such as high government debt, climate change impacts, digital transformation costs, and defense spending pressures. These factors may negatively affect economic growth and government revenues."
19 June 2024,Euro area monthly balance of payments: April 2024,Positive,"The euro area current account balance recorded a surplus of €39 billion in April 2024, an increase from the previous month. This suggests improved trade and investment dynamics for the euro area, which could potentially strengthen the EUR/USD exchange rate."
18 June 2024,Strengthening European financial markets to ensure a more resilient future,Negative,"The text indicates a disappointing progress towards greater financial integration in the euro area, particularly in terms of cross-border bank lending and equity markets. It also highlights the fragmented European banking sector, obstacles to integration due to national prudential and resolution requirements, and the need for harmonising bank crisis management across the banking union."
18 June 2024,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 14 June 2024,Neutral,"The publication primarily provides information about the Eurosystem's financial statement and statistics, with no clear indications of changes in monetary policy or significant economic conditions that could directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate."
18 June 2024,How banks deal with declining excess liquidity,Neutral,"The publication discusses the decline of excess liquidity in the Eurosystem and how banks are adjusting to this change. It highlights that banks have been effectively redistributing liquidity through repo markets and covered bond markets, which has prevented a significant increase in usage of central bank refinancing operations. While it suggests that more funding needs will emerge as excess liquidity declines further, the recently announced changes in the operational framework aim to address these challenges."
18 June 2024,Will the euro area car sector recover?,Negative,"The analysis indicates that the euro area car sector is currently facing significant challenges, with production and exports declining since early 2018. The decline in activity was triggered by a drop in sales of combustion engine cars, supply chain disruptions, higher energy costs, tight financing conditions, and regulatory changes. Additionally, euro area automotive industry has lost market share over the past few years compared to competitors like China, Japan, the United States, and Korea. Despite some resilience demonstrated by the industry, these factors suggest a negative outlook for the near future."
18 June 2024,"Completing banking union and capital markets union is crucial, ECB report shows",Negative,"The publication highlights a lack of progress in financial integration within the euro area, which is considered crucial for meeting common challenges such as green and digital transitions. The report suggests that indicators of financial integration have declined significantly over the past two years and policy action is now urgently needed."
18 June 2024,Financial Integration and Structure in the Euro Area,Neutral,"The text provides an overview of various aspects related to the European Central Bank, financial markets, and financial integration in Europe. However, it does not contain clear positive or negative sentiments that would warrant a classification as 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Very Positive', or 'Very Negative'."
18 June 2024,Rapid growth and strategic location: Analysing the rise of FinTechs in the EU,Positive,"The text discusses various initiatives and regulations aimed at supporting FinTech innovation in the European Union. These include regulatory sandboxes, innovation hubs, and incubators. The EU Digital Finance Platform is also mentioned as a collaborative space that offers practical tools to facilitate the scaling up of innovative financial firms across the EU."
18 June 2024,Examining the causes and consequences of the recent listing gap between the United States and Europe,Negative,"The trend of larger companies delisting from EU exchanges or choosing not to list in Europe at all, in favor of US exchanges, suggests a potential negative impact on the depth and liquidity of EU stock markets. This could lead to a negative feedback loop whereby the lack of public listings leads to further delistings, while the opposite dynamic materialises in the United States."
18 June 2024,Do EU SURE and NGEU bonds contribute to financial integration?,Neutral,"While the EU has made efforts to establish EU bonds as a common safe asset, their temporary nature and less liquid status compared to high-quality euro-denominated sovereign bonds continue to pose challenges. Additionally, market participants still view EU bonds as more similar to supranational issuers than euro area sovereign issuers. More analysis is needed once the issuance of EU bonds reaches a more sizeable level to determine their impact on financial integration."
18 June 2024,Intra-euro area cross-border bank lending: a boost to banking market integration?,Negative,"The text discusses the limited progress in banking market integration within the euro area, which could potentially harm small firms' borrowing conditions due to reduced cross-border lending. Additionally, it highlights that only a few large banking groups are active in cross-border lending."
18 June 2024,Home bias and repo rates,Negative,"The text discusses a study that finds a negative effect on funding costs for banks holding geographically diversified government bond portfolios in repo markets. This is because, all else being equal, using domestic collateral (wrong-way collateral) in these markets is more expensive due to the correlation premium."
18 June 2024,Reassessing euro area financial integration: the role of euro area financial centres,Positive,"The provided text discusses the impact of European Asset Finance Centers (EAFCs) on capital markets within the Euro Area. It highlights that firms issuing bonds through EAFCs have a wider investor base within the Euro Area compared to those issued domestically, thus approximating the policy goal of a Capital Markets Union. This suggests a potential positive effect on cross-border financial integration."
18 June 2024,The derivatives clearing landscape in the euro area three years after Brexit,Neutral,"The text provided discusses the current state of EU clearing markets and upcoming changes, such as the EMIR 3 regulation. While it indicates potential benefits for euro area CCPs, it does not provide specific indicators that suggest a significantly positive or negative outlook."
18 June 2024,Massive investment needs to meet EU green and digital targets,Negative,"Significant investment needs in both green and digital sectors have been identified, with annual investment needs increasing to €1,507 billion and €173 billion respectively by 2030. The European Commission expects these investments to increase further due to climate change impacts and the need for adaptation. This represents a substantial challenge given that total investment in the EU was only around 22% of GDP in 2020."
17 June 2024,Sectoral dynamics and the business cycle in the euro area,Positive,"The text discusses a model that identifies sectors with leading-indicator characteristics for overall economic activity, including manufacturing and trade, transport and hospitality. These findings are robust to the exclusion of Ireland and/or the post-pandemic period."
14 June 2024,Policymaking in a new risk environment,Neutral,"The text provides an analysis of the new risks and challenges faced by policymakers, particularly those related to geopolitical conflicts and climate change. However, it also suggests that there is scope for action and that policymakers can find balanced ways to move forward in this uncertain environment."
13 June 2024,ECB publishes consolidated banking data for end-December 2023,Neutral,"The publication provides detailed data about the EU banking sector, including profitability, balance sheet composition, liquidity, and capital adequacy. While it does not directly suggest any significant changes in monetary policy or economic outlook, the inclusion of Croatia in the Euro area countries indicates an expansion of the data set. This neutral tone is further supported by the disclaimer stating that some small and medium-sized reporters may apply national accounting standards."
13 June 2024,Making the digital euro truly private,Positive,"The article emphasizes the ECB's focus on ensuring privacy and robust data protection for the digital euro, making it a more private payment option compared to other electronic means. This is likely to encourage more widespread adoption of the digital euro, which could potentially decrease the demand for physical cash and increase the use of digital payments, leading to a stronger euro in terms of circulation."
12 June 2024,Why Europe must safeguard its global currency status,Positive,"The article emphasizes the need for more reforms to maintain and strengthen the euro's global currency status, which implies a positive outlook towards the euro's role in the international monetary system."
12 June 2024,Views regarding the internationalisation of central bank digital currencies and their implications for the euro area,Positive,"The publication discusses the internationalization of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the potential impact on the euro area, particularly focusing on the digital euro project. It highlights efforts by China to explore the international use of their CBDC (e-CNY), but also mentions UK's planned digital pound and US's consideration of a CBDC. The text suggests that a digital euro could bring strategic advantages, such as strengthening Europe’s strategic autonomy and resilience, and it envisages the use of digital euro outside the euro area to foster the international use of the euro."
12 June 2024,Sovereign wealth funds and the euro area: preliminary evidence,Neutral,"The data provided suggests a neutral classification. The analysis indicates that there is significant investment activity by Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), but the impact on global financial markets seems to be a topic of ongoing research. The US dollar is often used as a vehicle currency for purchases of assets not involving US-based firms, while the euro remains a distant second and is occasionally used to finance acquisitions by SWFs of firms located outside the euro area. There is also evidence of capital flowing from advanced economies towards emerging markets contrary to neoclassical models. However, without more specific data on the relative volumes, impacts, and trends, it is difficult to definitively classify this information as positive or negative."
12 June 2024,International use of the euro remained broadly stable in 2023,Negative,"The text indicates a decrease in the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves and other indicators of international role, such as the outstanding stock of international deposits and loans. The potential fragmentation of global payment systems is also mentioned as a risk. These factors suggest a negative impact on the euro's international standing and thus its value relative to the USD."
12 June 2024,"The international role of the euro, June 2024",Neutral,"The data provided does not indicate a significant shift in the global economy or financial markets that would justify a classification as Very Negative, Negative, Positive, or Very Positive."

11 April 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB has maintained its interest rates and indicated a determination to keep them restrictive.

8 April 2024,Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area - First quarter of 2024,Negative,"Euro area enterprises expect a risk to the upside for inflation expectations in five years. The study shows that firms with increasing profits are more likely to expect positive price changes, but the average relationship is close to that of firms with decreasing profits.

7 March 2024,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The publication indicates a continued tight monetary policy stance by the ECB, with interest rates expected to remain high and the Asset Purchase Program (APP) portfolio reduction continuing.

The data shows a steady decrease in both inflation perceptions over the previous 12 months (from 9.6 to 8.9) and inflation expectations 12 months ahead (from 5.3 to 5.0).

22 March 2024,Who buys bonds now? How markets deal with a smaller Eurosystem balance sheet,Positive,"The article highlights an increased availability of euro area government bonds due to the Eurosystem's balance sheet reduction and record amounts of debt issued by governments across the euro area. This has helped bring the Eurosystem’s footprint in government bond markets closer to pre-pandemic levels. Domestic and foreign investors, particularly households and foreign investors, have stepped in to absorb the increasing amount of government bonds available. The article emphasizes that this reduction went very smoothly, with net issuance of bonds being absorbed by these investors."
21 March 2024,Denmark joins T2 and TIPS to fully integrate Danish krone in Eurosystem’s payment services,Positive,"The agreement allows Denmark to join the ECB's T2 and TIPS systems, integrating Danish krone in Eurosystem’s payment services.

While it reports a decline in the share of the euro in total Swift payment messages post-March 2023, this drop is explained by technical changes such as the launch of the consolidated T2-T2S platform and the market’s move to the new ISO 20022 message standard. The analysis also confirms that euro payments involving at least one bank located outside the euro area have remained stable. Overall, no significant change in the global role or strength of the euro is suggested."
21 March 2024,Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations from 1 November 2023 to 30 January 2024,Neutral,"The report indicates a neutral trend in liquidity conditions for euro area banks. The average amount of liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments decreased, primarily due to the roll-off of monetary policy portfolios and the maturing and early repayment of TLTRO III operations.

The analysis also suggests that speculation has limited effect in amplifying price reactions to fundamental shocks in periods of heightened geopolitical tensions."
20 March 2024,R(ising) star?,Neutral,"The text provides an analysis and discussion of the factors influencing the natural rate of interest (r*). It highlights the impact of monetary policy, innovation, financial stability, demographic trends, climate change policies, and the role of safe assets on r*.

Overall, the text presents a balanced view without taking a clear position."
20 March 2024,What were the drivers of euro area food price inflation over the last two years?,Negative,"Food inflation in the euro area has risen sharply owing to high energy and food commodity prices.

The data will help them understand if wages are growing in a way that is compatible with inflation reaching their target sustainably by mid-2025 and provide a new set of projections that will confirm whether the inflation path they foresaw in their March forecast remains valid. Until then, the ECB's decisions will remain data dependent and meeting-by-meeting."

19 March 2024,The impact of recent shocks and ongoing structural changes on euro area productivity growth,Negative,A sharp increase in carbon prices to €150 for all emissions within the EU ETS could put at least one-tenth of manufacturing firms currently covered by the ETS in major euro area economies at risk of making losses.
19 March 2024,Shocked to the core: a new model to understand euro area inflation,Negative,"The article discusses the surge in inflation caused by supply shocks from global supply chains and natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Understanding why cash remains important for so many,Positive,"The text presents an analysis of the use and preference for digital payment tools versus cash, focusing on a less digitalized group. The findings suggest that this group tends to rely more on physical banking services and use cash infrastructure more frequently than the rest of the population.

Additionally, the text discusses the future relevance of both online and offline shopping options due to the diversity of consumer preferences."

11 January 2024,Net interest income of households and firms,Negative,"The publication discusses the impact of rising interest rates on net interest income of households and firms. It indicates that the net interest income of firms has declined since the rate hiking cycle began in 2022, resulting in lower investment. Additionally, it mentions that the net interest income of euro area households has increased slightly but its positive effect on consumption has been smaller than the negative effect of higher interest rates transmitted through other channels."

11 January 2024,Potential output in times of temporary supply shocks,Positive,The article discusses alternative estimates of potential output and the output gap that may provide better short-term forecasts of inflation in times of temporary supply shocks than an output gap estimate based on a smooth notion of potential output. This suggests that these indicators could be beneficial for forecasting during such periods.
11 January 2024,US Treasury market conditions and global market reactions to US monetary policy,Negative,"The empirical analysis suggests that both domestic and global bond market reactions to US monetary policy might be stronger under certain US Treasury market conditions. The findings could help explain part of the relatively large adjustments in US Treasury yields observed during 2023, as declining Treasury market liquidity might be one of the factors contributing to higher yield sensitivity. This implies potential risks for bond markets and investor portfolios."

10 January 2024,Monetary dynamics during the tightening cycle,Negative,"The current monetary policy tightening in the euro area has weakened broader money creation, pushed it into negative territory at a historically low level.

8 January 2024,ECB publishes new statistics on the distribution of household wealth,Positive,"The publication focuses on the distribution of household wealth, which supports financial stability and fairness in income distribution.

The ECB researchers estimate that food inflation could rise significantly due to extreme summer heat, and this effect may be more pronounced in the future. Moreover, climate change can make inflation more volatile and pose challenges for central banks in accurately forecasting inflation and conducting monetary policy.

The ECB does not share the concern about holding rates at a high level for too long as it is data-dependent and will adjust its policies accordingly as more information becomes available."
14 December 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Neutral,"The decision to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged suggests a neutral stance, as it maintains the current monetary policy. The slight downward revision in inflation expectations for 2023 and especially for 2024 could be seen as slightly negative, but it is balanced by the expectation of economic recovery starting from 2024."
14 December 2023,Monetary policy statement (with Q&A),Neutral,"The ECB has stated that it will continue to monitor its three criteria (inflation, employment, and interest rates) closely.

14 December 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Neutral,"The ECB statement indicates a continuation of the current monetary policy stance, with interest rates unchanged and ongoing reduction of the PEPP portfolio.

However, the focus on reducing inflation to target levels and continued flexibility in reinvesting redemptions indicate a tightening bias, which may have positive or negative impacts depending on market expectations."
14 December 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Neutral,"The text does not provide clear indications of an immediate or strong impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate. The Governing Council is keeping interest rates unchanged, but they expect inflation to decline gradually over the course of next year.

28 September 2023,The fiscal impact of financial sector support measures 15 years after the great financial crisis,Negative,"The publication discusses the ongoing impact of financial sector support measures taken during the global financial crisis on euro area public finances. It notes that while the debt and deficit impact has decreased, it still leaves a mark 15 years later. This could indicate potential future challenges for fiscal policy, which may negatively affect the euro/USD exchange rate."
28 September 2023,Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations from 10 May to 1 August 2023,Neutral,"The publication provides an analysis of liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations from May to August 2023. While it reports a significant decrease in excess liquidity during the review period, this is mainly due to the maturing of TLTRO III operations and banks' early repayments of other TLTRO funds, as well as the gradual reduction in the size of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio. The continued decline in net autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements partly offsets the reduction in excess liquidity. The average amount of liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments decreased by €326.6 billion during the review period, but this was driven primarily by a decline in credit operations. Overall, the publication does not indicate a clear direction for the EUR/USD exchange rate."
28 September 2023,What do consumers think is the main driver of recent inflation?,Positive,"The findings from the Consumer Expectations Survey suggest that perceptions about the main drivers of inflation are associated with how consumers form their medium-term inflation expectations.

28 September 2023,What role do reopening effects play across countries and sectors?,Negative,Growth dispersion across sectors and countries is expected to decline in the near future due to the fading of reopening effects and the economy-wide propagation of other forces such as tighter financing conditions. This weaker near-term outlook for economic activity reflects a decline in momentum in both manufacturing and contact-intensive services.
28 September 2023,Risks to global food prices from El Niño,Negative,"The outlook for international food commodity prices suggests a negative classification due to ongoing El Niño developments. The NOAA announcement on 8 June that El Niño conditions had arrived, together with a probability of around 50% assigned to the development of a strong El Niño phenomenon towards the end of the year, has caused significant increases in futures prices and price uncertainty for soybeans and corn. These developments mainly reflect unfavourable weather developments in the northern hemisphere at the beginning of June."

However, few of these firms are investing in becoming more resilient to these risks. This is potentially negative because businesses not taking proactive steps to adapt to climate change could face increased vulnerability to future events."

27 September 2023,Monetary developments in the euro area: August 2023,Negative,"The ECB publication shows a decline in the annual growth rate of M3, the broad monetary aggregate, and total credit to euro area residents.

27 September 2023,Interview with Market News International,Positive,"The ECB is taking a proactive stance in addressing climate change risks, setting deadlines for banks to meet their expectations and using all instruments to enforce these deadlines.

25 September 2023,Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Negative,"The text indicates that the economy in the euro area is stagnating, with lower demand for exports and tight financing conditions dampening growth. Additionally, inflation remains high and is projected to stay above the target for some time. The ECB's decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points is a response to this situation, suggesting further monetary tightening in the near future which may put downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate."

This research emphasizes the importance of understanding investor demand in corporate decisions and economic activity."

Additionally, food inflation remains high at 10%, and there is potential for it to rise further due to adverse weather conditions and geopolitical tensions."
14 September 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The text indicates that the ECB is raising interest rates to combat high inflation, which will likely strengthen the euro relative to the USD. Additionally, economic growth projections have been significantly lowered due to the tightening of financing conditions and the weakening international trade environment."
14 September 2023,Monetary policy statement (with Q&A),Negative,"The ECB raised its key interest rates by 25 basis points in an effort to combat high inflation, which could slow down the economic growth, especially in countries like Italy where most of the economic activity depends on banks.

14 September 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB has raised its key interest rates by 25 basis points and is expected to maintain restrictive levels for a sufficiently long duration. This move aims at reducing inflation, but it will likely put pressure on economic growth projections which have been significantly lowered.

14 September 2023,President Lagarde presents the latest monetary policy decisions – 14 September 2023,Neutral,"The ECB's presentation provides an overview of monetary policy decisions and related topics, but it does not offer specific indications about future changes that would significantly affect the EUR/USD exchange rate."
14 September 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB has decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, indicating a tightening monetary policy stance. This decision is based on the ongoing high inflation and an expectation of a slowdown in economic growth.

It shows an increase in interest rate expectations for both mortgages and savings accounts, as well as an increasing share of respondents who expect to have difficulties meeting their mortgage payments and report a preference for lower interest rates.

4 August 2023,Underlying inflation measures: an analytical guide for the euro area,Negative,"Underlying inflation measures continue to show high levels, and the disinflationary path in the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections is consistent with the fading-out of the reverting component connected to last year's surge in energy prices and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks.

Weakness was mainly concentrated in the construction and intermediate goods sectors, while there are concerns about the weaker-than-expected recovery of the Chinese economy and what this would mean both for exports and for import competition.

27 July 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The publication indicates an increase in interest rates by the ECB, which is likely to strengthen the USD relative to the EUR due to its impact on global liquidity and risk appetite. Additionally, the intention to reinvest principal payments from maturing securities under PEPP until at least 2024 suggests a prolonged accommodative monetary policy stance, potentially putting downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate."

27 July 2023,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The text indicates an increase in interest rates by the ECB which is generally considered bearish for the euro, as it increases borrowing costs and reduces demand for the currency. Additionally, the continued intention to reinvest PEPP principal payments until at least the end of 2024 implies a continuation of easy monetary policy, which also puts downward pressure on the euro."
27 July 2023,ECB adjusts remuneration of minimum reserves,Neutral,"The decision to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at 0% can be considered neutral as it does not necessarily imply a change in monetary policy stance, but rather an adjustment to preserve its effectiveness and efficiency. The move aligns with the current high level of key ECB interest rates."

This change is due to rising interest rates and elevated real estate prices pushing up servicing costs for mortgages, resulting in higher shares of new loans with DSTIs over 30%. This upward pressure on DSTIs could continue in 2023, potentially constraining access to the mortgage market as interest rates are increasing."
3 July 2023,General considerations on conditions that could inform potential buffer releases in the future,Neutral,"The publication discusses potential factors that could inform future decisions to release capital buffers, but does not provide specific indications of current risks or materialisation of financial stability issues in the euro area as a whole."

These factors are typically associated with an increase in interest rates, which can put upward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate if US interest rates remain unchanged."
29 June 2023,How have unit profits contributed to the recent strengthening of euro area domestic price pressures?,Positive,"Unit profits in the Euro Area have been growing strongly and contributing to domestic price pressures.

27 June 2023,Breaking the persistence of inflation,Negative,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is facing a more persistent inflation process. The ECB will continue to increase rates in July and needs to pay close attention to the level and length of its policy, as uncertainty about the persistence of inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission remain. The services sector may be insulated from the effects of policy tightening for longer than in the past, which could affect the strength of transmission. Additionally, the euro area has not been through a sustained phase of rate hikes since the mid-2000s and has never seen rates rise so quickly, adding to uncertainty about the speed and force of monetary policy transmission."
26 June 2023,The role of supply and demand in the post-pandemic recovery in the euro area,Negative,"The analysis indicates a negative economic outlook due to ongoing supply chain disruptions, heightened by factors such as the semiconductor shortage and shipping costs.

25 June 2023,Interview with ABC,Negative,"The interview emphasizes on the ECB's concern about inflation and their focus on reducing it, which could put downward pressure on the euro as a lower value currency tends to fight inflation.

23 June 2023,Remarks at the Summit for a new global financing pact,Positive,"The speech emphasizes the need for a global transition to combat climate change, which requires efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting economies to shield them from climate change. The ECB is taking active steps to support this transition by adjusting their corporate bond holdings, changing collateral and risk management, and stress testing the impact of climate change on the economy and financial stability."
22 June 2023,ECB publishes consolidated banking data for end-December 2022,Neutral,"The publication provides consolidated banking data for end-December 2022. While it offers insights into the profitability, efficiency, and capital adequacy of EU banks, it does not necessarily indicate a directional impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
22 June 2023,Central clearing in turbulent times: frontiers in regulation and oversight,Positive,"The text discusses the importance of central counterparties (CCPs) in managing counterparty risk and enhancing market transparency. It emphasizes the need for a robust set-up that addresses margin procyclicality, excessive exposures to third-country CCPs, and crisis coordination. The European Central Bank supports these measures and encourages stakeholders to balance short-term cost considerations against the benefits of a resilient financial system."
22 June 2023,Navigating liquidity crises in non-banks: An assessment of central bank policies,Positive,"The paper presents evidence that the ECB's intervention during a severe liquidity crisis reached non-banks through central bank asset purchases, particularly effective in this case. This suggests that even though funds did not have direct access to the lender of last resort, they could still benefit from such interventions."
21 June 2023,International use of the euro was resilient in 2022,Positive,"The report highlights the resilience of the international role of the euro in 2022 despite geopolitical risks and rising inflationary pressures.

While there is a decline in US dollar-denominated bond issuance across various regions, the data suggests a different pattern compared to the data on the stock of international debt securities. The text also mentions the potential impact of Brexit on London as a financial centre and the shift in equity trading of EU-listed corporates from the City of London to Amsterdam due to regulatory changes."
21 June 2023,The impact of war: extreme demand for euro cash in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,Negative,"The publication discusses the significant increase in demand for euro cash due to geopolitical conflicts, specifically Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Future developments will depend on various factors including regulatory considerations in both the UK and the EU."
21 June 2023,Valuation effects and rebalancing of official foreign exchange reserves,Negative,"The text discusses the impact of valuation effects on the shares of major reserve currencies, suggesting that central banks partially rebalance their portfolios in response to these changes but do not fully offset them.

21 June 2023,Investment funds and search for yield within the sovereign debt market of highly-rated issuers,Positive,"The analysis shows that US mutual funds have significant exposures to euro-denominated government debt securities issued by highly-rated euro area sovereigns. These exposures change over time in response to changes in relative yields, suggesting a strong influence of yield differentials on the global appeal of the euro as an investment currency."
21 June 2023,Internationalisation of the renminbi and capital account openness,Neutral,"The publication discusses the potential for the renminbi to play a stronger role as an international and reserve currency, but also acknowledges that China's capital account is not fully open and that the renminbi will still require dollar backing. Therefore, it does not indicate a significant positive or negative impact on the euro."
21 June 2023,Determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank loans,Positive,"The report suggests that the euro tends to be more of a regional currency, while use of the US dollar in cross-border bank lending is global. This indicates a positive outlook for the global role and appeal of the US dollar. Additionally, it implies that preserving openness in international trade and financial markets could support the global appeal of the euro."
21 June 2023,How is a leading international currency replaced by another? Old versus new evidence,Positive,"The text provides an informative analysis on the shift of dominant currency in trade invoicing, focusing particularly on the rise of the euro.

21 June 2023,"More digital, more productive?

Instead, it presents an overview of various aspects of the European Central Bank's operations and statistics."
20 June 2023,Euro area monthly balance of payments: April 2023,Negative,"The euro area current account balance recorded a decrease in the surplus, which is generally positive for the euro against the USD.

This implies continued upward pressure on prices, which could negatively impact the euro (EUR) against the US dollar (USD). Furthermore, the ECB's decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points again, making it a total of 400 basis points in less than a year, suggests a tightening monetary policy that could also put downward pressure on the euro."
16 June 2023,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication provides updates on various reports, opinions, recommendations, and schedules related to the ECB's operations, but it does not contain any significant monetary policy announcements or indicators that would directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate."

The European Central Bank (ECB) expresses concern about fiscal policies that may work against monetary policy goals, particularly in terms of preserving price stability and supporting investment.

27 October 2022,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB raised its key interest rates by 75 basis points and intends to continue raising them further. This move indicates a tighter monetary policy stance, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for both households and businesses in the euro area. This could potentially weaken demand and slow economic growth. Additionally, the ECB's decision to adjust the terms and conditions of TLTRO III suggests that they are taking steps to rein in stimulus measures, further adding to the negative impact on the economy."

The scenarios provide a common picture of possible futures under different assumptions, helping policy-makers, financial institutions, and the public deal with uncertainty. The release of these scenarios suggests that immediate coordinated action towards a greener economy would bring large benefits from 2030 onwards compared to doing nothing or a hot-house-world scenario."
15 November 2022,Can Europe be a green innovation leader?,Negative,"The publication highlights Europe's underperformance in green innovation compared to other regions. The lack of carbon pricing policies, insufficient venture capital investment, and low R&D spending are seen as barriers for green technology development.

16 November 2022,Financial stability risks from energy derivatives markets,Negative,"The text discusses the increased volatility in European and global energy markets, which has led to margin requirements on futures and swaps contracts used by energy producers and distributors increasing almost twofold.

The scenarios aim at exploring plausible futures for financial risk assessment in an environment of radical uncertainty. The results suggest that acting now (Orderly transition) would be somewhat more expensive at the beginning but bring large benefits from 2030 onwards, while a hot-house-world scenario would have extremely severe long-term implications. Therefore, immediate action is beneficial for the economy in the long run."

28 October 2022,Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies,Negative,"The publication suggests a marked slowdown in activity, broadly consistent with stagnation, and anticipates a further deterioration in activity in the fourth quarter, implying a contraction.

This recalibration will contribute to the normalisation of bank funding costs, exert downward pressure on inflation, and facilitate early voluntary repayment of outstanding TLTRO III funds. These actions suggest a tightening monetary policy stance which could strengthen the euro against the USD."
27 October 2022,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB has decided to raise interest rates by 75 basis points, indicating a tightening of monetary policy. This move is likely to strengthen the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, as higher interest rates typically attract capital. Additionally, the ECB's intention to further raise interest rates and recalibrate the terms of its targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) also supports a negative outlook for the euro."
27 October 2022,ECB adjusts remuneration of minimum reserves,Neutral,The change in remuneration of minimum reserves from the main refinancing operations (MRO) rate to the deposit facility rate (DFR) is a technical adjustment rather than a policy decision that could significantly impact monetary policy or the EUR/USD exchange rate.
27 October 2022,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The publication indicates that the ECB is raising interest rates by 75 basis points, which is a monetary tightening move. This action reduces liquidity in the market and makes borrowing more expensive, putting downward pressure on the euro (EUR) value relative to other currencies such as the US dollar (USD).

27 October 2022,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The ECB's decision to raise interest rates by 75 basis points, along with the changes in the terms and conditions of TLTRO III and minimum reserves remuneration, are signs of a tightening monetary policy. This move is expected to strengthen the US dollar against the euro due to higher US interest rates and a stronger U.S. economic outlook."
27 October 2022,Monetary policy statement (with Q&A),Positive,"The decision to adjust the terms of TLTROs by the European Central Bank is aimed at facilitating the transmission of its monetary policy stance. This move will lead to higher lending costs, but it is necessary given the current inflationary environment."

27 October 2022,ECB adjusts remuneration of minimum reserves,Neutral,"The publication does not provide specific information that would indicate a significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate. The decision to adjust the remuneration of minimum reserves is an internal monetary policy action, which usually does not have a direct and immediate effect on currency exchange rates."
24 November 2022,Meeting of 26-27 October 2022,Negative,"The transcript indicates a worsening inflation outlook due to an energy crisis, which has led to changes in the terms and conditions of the TLTRO III operations. This tightens monetary policy and could potentially slow economic growth."

This trend is likely to put downward pressure on demand for loans, which decreased substantially for housing loans and also decreased in net terms for consumer credit. The tightening financial market conditions as monetary policy normalises could further exacerbate these trends."
20 October 2022,Eurosystem reschedules start of renewed wholesale payment system,Neutral,"The postponement of the launch of a new payment system (T2) by the European Central Bank does not inherently indicate positive or negative implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Why it matters for monetary policy,Negative,"The article discusses a study that finds significant wage and wealth gaps between immigrants and non-immigrants in the euro area, with immigrants earning roughly 25-30% lower wages and holding much less wealth compared to non-immigrants.

10 October 2022,Gauging the sensitivity of loan-service-to-income (LSTI) ratios to increases in interest rates,Neutral,"The publication discusses the sensitivity of loan-service-to-income (LSTI) ratios to interest rate increases. While it suggests that a higher initial LTI ratio, longer maturity, shorter interest rate fixation period, and lower initial interest rate at loan origination will lead to a larger increase in the LSTI ratio for a given change in the interest rate, it does not provide specific predictions or indicate potential directions of the euro (EUR)/USD exchange rate."
10 October 2022,Evaluating housing market risks using a combined demand-supply framework,Negative,"The publication highlights that euro area house prices are more than 10% above their equilibrium level, which is similar to the figure assessed before the global financial crisis.

However, it also acknowledges that a tightening of monetary policy may have a modest impact on valuations in housing markets."
10 October 2022,ECB and People’s Bank of China extend bilateral euro-renminbi currency swap arrangement,Neutral,"The extension of the currency swap arrangement between the ECB and PBC is a regular practice, not presenting any surprising changes or signals.

However, it also highlights data gaps within Europe that could impact the effectiveness of these policies."
7 October 2022,The role of demand and supply in underlying inflation – decomposing HICPX inflation into components,Negative,"The analysis indicates that both supply and demand factors have contributed to the increase in HICPX (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices excluding energy and unprocessed food) inflation since mid-2021. However, supply factors have played a somewhat bigger role in non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) inflation since early 2021. This is particularly evident in components such as motor cars and major household appliances, which are classified as mainly supply-driven. On the other hand, demand factors are more important for services inflation than for NEIG inflation. These findings could suggest potential downside pressure on consumer prices due to ongoing supply chain disruptions and strong demand."
7 October 2022,ECB Consumer Expectations Survey results – August 2022,Negative,"The publication presents a continued increase in perceived inflation, which may negatively impact the EUR/USD exchange rate by reducing purchasing power of euros. Additionally, consumers' expectations for nominal income growth and spending growth over the next 12 months also increased, potentially putting further pressure on consumer prices."
7 October 2022,Economic growth and labour markets,Negative,"The publication from the ECB contains results of a consumer expectations survey on economic growth and labor markets. The survey indicates negative expectations for economic growth (both mean and median values decreased), increased perceived current unemployment rate, and higher expected unemployment rate 12 months ahead. These findings suggest pessimistic sentiment among consumers about the short-term economic outlook."

7 October 2022,Housing and credit access,Neutral,"The European Central Bank publication provides insights about the latest results from the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) related to housing market and credit access. While it does not disclose any specific monetary policy decisions or macroeconomic indicators, the data on home price expectations and mortgage interest rate expectations may indicate trends in housing demand and supply, which can influence economic growth. However, without additional context or interpretation, it is difficult to definitively classify the content as having a positive or negative impact on the euro (EUR)/USD exchange rate."
7 October 2022,Inflation perceptions and expectations,Negative,"The report presents increasing inflation perceptions over the previous 12 months (mean of 9.7%) and expected inflation for the next 12 months (mean of 6.9%). This suggests a negative outlook for the euro, as higher inflation tends to weaken the currency value."
6 October 2022,Meeting of 7-8 September 2022,Negative,"The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to raise its key interest rates by 75 basis points in response to persistent and higher-than-expected inflation. This decision, while necessary to combat rising prices, may lead to a slowdown in economic activity, which could mitigate inflationary pressures."
8 September 2022,Monetary policy decisions,Negative,"The publication indicates that the ECB is raising interest rates by 75 basis points, which will increase borrowing costs for euro area countries and businesses. This decision was made due to persistently high inflation (9.1% in August) and expectations of further rate increases in the near future. Additionally, the economic outlook has been revised down significantly for the remainder of 2022 and throughout 2023, with growth expected to stagnate later this year and in the first quarter of 2023."

5 October 2022,Households and non-financial corporations in the euro area: second quarter of 2022,Neutral,"The publication provides an analysis of household and non-financial corporation financial data in the Eurozone, with no clear indications of a significant shift in the economic trend. While there are some deceleration in growth rates for certain indicators like consumption expenditure, gross entrepreneurial income, and net worth, these decreases were to some extent expected given the overall economic context."
5 October 2022,Euro area quarterly balance of payments and international investment position: second quarter of 2022,Negative,"The decrease in the euro area current account surplus is a negative signal for the EUR/USD exchange rate. This is due to a strong reduction in the goods and primary income surpluses, which could potentially lead to increased imports and a weaker euro."
4 October 2022,Euro money market statistics: Fifth maintenance period 2022,Neutral,"The publication provides statistical data on borrowing and lending turnover in the Euro money market for a specific maintenance period. While there are slight changes in interest rates, these variations are within the expected range of fluctuations due to monetary policy actions.

4 October 2022,Euro area bank interest rate statistics: August 2022,Negative,"The text provides data showing an increase in interest rates on new loans to both corporations and households.

This could potentially weaken demand and economic growth in the euro area, impacting the EUR/USD exchange rate negatively."
30 September 2022,Monetary policy in a cost-of-living crisis,Negative,"Increase in key policy rates is expected to ensure inflation returns to target in a timely manner, potentially impacting growth and employment."
29 September 2022,Natura finis magistra – acknowledging nature-related risks to make finance thrive,Positive,"The publication acknowledges the materiality of nature-related financial risks and emphasizes the need for central banks, supervisors, regulators, and international standard setting bodies to address these risks. The ECB has already started integrating environmental risks into their banking supervision and has published a guide on supervisory expectations regarding risk management and disclosure. This suggests an active approach to addressing nature-related risks, which could lead to a more sustainable financial system and potentially a stable EUR/USD exchange rate."
29 September 2022,"Policy mix of the future: the role of monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies",Positive,"The publication discusses the importance of complementarity between monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policies. It highlights that structural fiscal policy, such as the Next Generation EU programme, can help raise the natural rate of interest and contribute to maintaining price stability. The text also suggests that these policies have been effective in addressing financial imbalances during crises and supporting the recovery of the economy."

The risk premium related to this geopolitical event is visible in the immediate aftermath but faded over time. This suggests ongoing geopolitical tensions could potentially resurface.
28 September 2022,Green QE and carbon pricing: looking at potential tools to fight climate change,Neutral,"The article discusses potential tools for central banks to address climate change, but it doesn't directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. The study finds that green QE can contribute modestly to climate change mitigation compared with a carbon tax, and its effectiveness depends on various factors such as the initial holdings of dirty assets by central banks."

26 September 2022,Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Negative,"The speech highlights a worsening economic outlook for the euro area, with growth expected to slow substantially and inflation remaining far too high.

22 September 2022,"Economic Bulletin Issue 6, 2022",Negative,"The report indicates an increase in inflation expectations among some professional forecasters in the Eurozone, with more than 5% reporting longer-term inflation expectations of 2.5% or above. This could potentially signal a risk of de-anchoring from the European Central Bank's stated medium-term inflation objective of below but close to 2%. If these expectations persist and are reflected in actual inflation, it could lead to higher interest rates and potentially dampen economic growth."
22 September 2022,Common minimum standards for incorporating climate change risks into in-house credit assessment systems in the Eurosystem,Positive,"The publication focuses on the ECB's plan to incorporate climate change risks into in-house credit assessment systems.

22 September 2022,The role of public employment during the COVID-19 crisis,Positive,"The publication discusses the increase in public employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has played an important role in supporting total employment. This trend is stronger than in past recessions and appears to be driven by the positive long-term trends in the health and education sectors. The increased temporary employment in these sectors is likely to have contributed positively to total employment growth."
22 September 2022,Interview with t-online,Negative,"In the interview, Ms Schnabel acknowledges that inflation remains high and will continue to increase in the short term despite recent interest rate hikes.

The timing of retirement decisions for around 175,000 workers was shifted forward. This suggests that health concerns played a role in the timing of retirement for older workers, which is an important finding.

This is because it aims to preserve monetary policy transmission, safeguard orderly market functioning and assess money markets adjustments.

4 August 2022,Income and consumption,Neutral,"The publication by the ECB presents aggregate data on consumer expectations regarding household income and consumption. While it does not contain explicit monetary policy signals, the focus on consumer spending and income expectations could be interpreted as a reflection of the economy's health.

1 August 2022,How higher oil prices could affect euro area potential output,Negative,"The recent increase in oil prices, as a result of various factors including demand recovery after the pandemic and supply constraints, is expected to negatively impact potential output in the medium term. According to elasticities derived from macroeconomic models, an increase of 1% in oil prices would imply a decline in the level of euro area potential output of around -0.02%. Assuming a permanent oil price shock of 40%, the level of potential output in the euro area would be revised down by -0.8% after four years."
1 August 2022,Household saving during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for the recovery of consumption,Negative,"The analysis suggests that the bulk of pandemic-induced savings were not expected to be spent until at least the spring of 2022, which could temper expectations of widespread pent-up demand and potentially limit an immediate boost to aggregate consumption in the euro area. Furthermore, the households that managed to save during the COVID-19 pandemic represent only about 20% of the population, with less exposure to energy-intensive consumption items. This limits the extent to which these savings can shield the ongoing recovery of consumption from the adverse impact of the recent surge in energy prices."

Why it matters for monetary policy,Negative,"The article discusses significant wage and wealth disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants in the euro area, with immigrants earning roughly 25-30% lower wages and holding much less wealth than non-immigrants. These gaps are large and persist over time, even after decades of living in the current home country.

14 September 2022,What drives inflation expectations of women and men?,Positive,"The article provides insights into how gender differences affect inflation perceptions and expectations, highlighting that while women and men might have different inflation expectations in certain areas, they tend to update their expectations in a similar fashion when considering specific spending categories.

22 July 2022,Results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2022,Negative,"The publication shows revised up inflation expectations for all horizons, which typically is negative for the EUR/USD exchange rate as higher inflation weakens purchasing power and reduces demand for the euro.

9 September 2021,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The ECB has decided to maintain its current policy rate and the pace of asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at a moderately lower pace than in the previous two quarters. This indicates that the ECB is taking steps to support accommodative financing conditions, which should help stimulate economic activity and keep inflation close to its target. The decision to continue purchasing flexibly according to market conditions also signals a commitment to countering any tightening of financing conditions inconsistent with this goal."
7 September 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 3 September 2021,Neutral,"The publication focuses on financial statements and information about the Eurosystem, its tools, and operations.

1 September 2021,Interview with El Confidencial,Negative,"The interview reveals concerns about potential risks associated with the ECB's monetary policy, such as the danger of overheating in certain sectors (real estate) and the difficulty in withdrawing extraordinary stimulus measures once the pandemic is over. The interview also suggests that there might be an increase in non-performing loans in the coming quarters."
31 August 2021,Climate change and monetary policy,Negative,"The article emphasizes the potential substantial increase in physical risks from climate change on companies and banks in Europe, which could lead to an increase in default probabilities. Additionally, the preliminary results of the economy-wide stress test suggest that physical risks from climate change will probably rise substantially."
31 August 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 27 August 2021,Neutral,"The publication does not contain specific information or indications about the Eurozone's monetary policy, economic performance, or future expectations that could significantly influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. It is primarily a financial statement and an overview of various statistical data and studies."

26 August 2021,Meeting of 21-22 July 2021,Negative,"The Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to maintain its monetary policy stance, which was perceived as negative by some members due to concerns about the potential persistence and magnitude of inflation overshooting implied by the revised forward guidance on interest rates."
26 August 2021,Monetary developments in the euro area: July 2021,Neutral,"The publication discusses the monetary developments in the euro area without providing significant new information that could suggest a strong positive or negative impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Additionally, it addresses potential tapering by the Federal Reserve without making strong predictions about its impact on the euro area."
24 August 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 20 August 2021,Neutral,"The publication does not provide direct information about the ECB's monetary policy or macroeconomic outlook, focusing instead on providing data and insights. The neutral tone of the text also supports this classification."
24 August 2021,The rise of non-bank finance and its implications for monetary policy transmission,Neutral,"The text provides an analysis of the impact of non-bank finance on monetary policy in the Eurozone, highlighting both the benefits and risks associated with this trend.

19 August 2021,Euro area monthly balance of payments: June 2021,Neutral,"The publication provides a detailed analysis of the euro area's balance of payments, but it does not directly impact monetary policy or exchange rates. The surplus in the current account indicates a positive trade position for the euro area, which could potentially strengthen the euro. However, this is offset by decreased net investments and eurosystem’s stock of reserve assets."
19 August 2021,The new monetary policy strategy: implications for rate forward guidance,Positive,"The ECB's announcement of a revision to its rate forward guidance, aimed at delivering its symmetric two per cent inflation target over the medium term, signals a commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy.

5 August 2021,The structural impact of the shift from defined benefits to defined contributions,Negative,"The shift towards defined contribution (DC) pension funds in the Dutch pension fund system, expected to increase from around 17% to 77%, could lead to structural changes in asset allocation. This change may lower the demand for long-duration bonds and swaps, potentially leading to yield curve steepening. Additionally, the shift towards DC products would increase the demand for equities, but it could also boost investment risk for households, making retirement savings more uncertain and income less equally distributed."
5 August 2021,Recent developments in pipeline pressures for non-energy industrial goods inflation in the euro area,Negative,"The publication discusses rising input costs, shipping costs, and supply chain issues that are leading to increased producer prices for intermediate goods in the euro area. These pressures have so far been smaller at later stages of the pricing chain than at the earlier stages, but there is a potential for these pressures to affect consumer prices (non-energy industrial goods) with a lag of around one year. If the upward movements in producer price inflation in recent months are passed through to consumer prices, it could lead to somewhat stronger developments in NEIG inflation, which could impact overall inflation dynamics in the euro area."
5 August 2021,Cross-sectoral dispersion in firms’ earnings expectations during the COVID-19 crisis,Negative,"The publication indicates an increase in cross-sectoral dispersion in earnings expectations across the euro area, with some sectors experiencing persistently subdued expected earnings compared to others.

It primarily serves as an informational resource.
3 August 2021,The role of government for the non-financial corporate sector during the COVID-19 crisis,Negative,"The report suggests that there are potential risks stemming from a tightening sovereign-bank-corporate nexus due to the support provided by euro area governments to NFCs during the COVID-19 crisis. Also, there are possible risks from further capital injections depending on the depth and duration of the crisis."
3 August 2021,The role of sectoral developments for wage growth in the euro area since the start of the pandemic,Neutral,"The publication does not provide explicit information that would directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate in a significant manner.

2 August 2021,COVID-19 and the increase in household savings: an update,Negative,"The publication discusses the increase in household savings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a lower consumption rate. The fact that much of the additional savings were involuntary and held in liquid assets suggests that the unwinding of these savings may not provide an immediate boost to private consumption."
2 August 2021,The implications of savings accumulated during the pandemic for the global economic outlook,Negative,"The analysis indicates that the large accumulation of household savings due to the pandemic is likely to limit consumption in the medium term. This suggests a potential downside risk for economic growth and may dampen global GDP, making the overall outlook negative."
29 July 2021,Interview with Handelsblatt,Neutral,"The interview does not provide any significant hints that could directly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate in either direction. The European banks' stress test results are expected to be robust, but there may be some outliers. There is discussion about monetary policy normalization and a central fiscal authority at European level, however, no firm timeline or specific impact on the exchange rate is mentioned."
29 July 2021,Meeting of 7 July 2021,Positive,"The ECB has announced a new monetary policy strategy with changes such as incorporating housing costs into the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), revising the formulation of the inflation target to be more clear and symmetric, and introducing an ambitious action plan to account for climate change implications.

The ECB has committed to implementing recommended changes to improve service resilience."
28 July 2021,Euro area economic and financial developments by institutional sector: first quarter of 2021,Negative,"The publication highlights a decrease in net saving and an increase in the household debt-to-income ratio, suggesting reduced disposable income and higher levels of indebtedness for households. Additionally, non-financial corporations also have an increased debt-to-GDP ratio. These factors could potentially negatively impact the euro (EUR) by reducing the purchasing power of Euro area residents and increasing uncertainty in the financial markets."
28 July 2021,A time-varying carbon tax to protect the environment while safeguarding the economy,Negative,"The publication discusses a proposed time-varying carbon tax aimed at mitigating climate change, which could potentially have a negative impact on the economy in the short term. The authors suggest that during economic downturns, the emphasis should be placed on macroeconomic stabilization over environmental protection, and that the carbon tax should be reduced during these times. This proposed policy would likely lead to increased emissions during recessions, which could depreciate the value of the euro against the USD."
27 July 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 23 July 2021,Neutral,"The publication provides an overview of the Eurosystem's financial statement and various aspects of its operations, but it does not contain any explicit monetary policy signals or macroeconomic insights that could significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate.

27 July 2021,After the crisis: Economic lessons from the pandemic,Positive,"The text discusses the introduction of new common fiscal instruments, the recognition that reforms are more likely to emerge in a growing economy, and the explicit commitment by EU countries to transform their economies using European funding. These changes have the potential to positively impact the eurozone's economy, leading to stronger economic growth and potentially a strengthening of the euro."
26 July 2021,Macroeconomic impact of Basel III finalisation on the euro area,Positive,"The analysis suggests that the economic costs of implementing Basel III finalization are moderate and temporary, while the long-term benefits are substantial. The postponement of phase-in to 2023 has brought these costs closer to pre-COVID levels. However, it is important to note that certain assumptions in this analysis may lead to an overstatement of the reform's costs."
23 July 2021,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication contains updates and decisions from the ECB, but it does not explicitly provide information that would significantly impact the euro/USD exchange rate in either a positive or negative direction."

23 July 2021,Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies,Positive,"The report indicates strong growth in the euro area overall, with increased demand and expanding employment. The expected continued growth over the summer months also suggests a positive outlook for the economy."

This is likely due to the economic recovery progressing, leading to reduced liquidity needs and improved revenues."
20 July 2021,July 2021 euro area bank lending survey,Positive,"The survey indicates that credit standards remained broadly unchanged for loans or credit lines to enterprises and households in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, banks reported a moderate increase in firms' demand for loans or drawing of credit lines, suggesting an improvement in economic activity.

1 July 2021,Joint ECB/ESRB report shows uneven impacts of climate change for the EU financial sector,Negative,"The publication discusses potential financial stability risks and losses associated with climate change, emphasizing the urgency of climate policies. It highlights concentration of exposure to physical and transition risks across regions, sectors, and specific European financial intermediaries, as well as the potential decline in global GDP by the end of the century if mitigation proves insufficient."
29 June 2021,Financing a green and digital recovery,Positive,"The publication emphasizes on the opportunity for Europe to shift towards a more sustainable, more productive economy with higher labor productivity growth. The ECB suggests initiatives such as a green capital markets union (CMU) to channel public and private sector investment towards green and digital sectors, which could potentially drive economic transformation."
29 June 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 25 June 2021,Neutral,"The publication provides an overview of the Eurosystem's financial statement, monetary policy, and various studies. It does not contain any information that would significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate."
28 June 2021,Euro area banks in the recovery,Positive,"The publication presents a positive outlook for the euro area economy and financial stability, with improved GDP growth forecasts and stabilized sovereign debt markets. The banking sector, in particular, is said to have weathered the pandemic crisis thanks to extraordinary policy measures. Despite ongoing challenges, the better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter of 2021 should be seen as a sign of recovery."
28 June 2021,Monetary-fiscal interactions on the way out of the crisis,Positive,"The article discusses the potential benefits of a coordinated monetary and fiscal policy response, particularly in situations where interest rates are near the lower bound. It suggests that such an approach can help close output and inflation gaps, dispel pessimistic expectations, and ensure the endurance of a regime of price stability."
28 June 2021,What makes banks adjust dividend payouts?,Negative,"The article discusses a simulation that suggests, in the absence of prudential constraints, a significant part of bank profits would have been paid out to shareholders in 2020. This could potentially lead to insufficient capital retention during times of economic uncertainty."
28 June 2021,Evaluating the impact of dividend restrictions on euro area bank valuations,Negative,"The text discusses the negative impact of the ECB's March 2020 recommendation on bank share prices. The analysis suggests that uncertainty over future distributions, rather than the mechanical postponement of dividend payouts, explains a major part of the negative impact on bank valuations."
28 June 2021,Evaluating the benefits of euro area dividend distribution recommendations on lending and provisioning,Positive,"The article discusses the impact of ECB's dividend policy recommendation on banks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings suggest that the policy has been effective in mitigating potential procyclical adjustments, increasing lending by around 2.4%, and building up provisions for absorbing future losses by approximately 5.5%. However, the effectiveness depends on banks' proximity to the capital conservation buffer (CCB), with banks close to CCB benefiting less. The article provides insights into potential interactions between banks' unwillingness to breach CCB and the additional capital generated by dividend suspension policies."
28 June 2021,System-wide measures on banks’ distributions – motivations and challenges,Neutral,"This text provides an analysis of the impact and implications of system-wide restrictions on bank dividend payments. While it acknowledges potential benefits such as maintaining capital levels, supporting the real economy, and addressing deleveraging incentives, it also highlights drawbacks like negative effects on bank valuations, investor reluctance, interference with the smooth functioning of the internal market, and the soft legal nature of instruments establishing restrictions."
28 June 2021,Changes to the Eurosystem’s loan-level data requirements,Neutral,"The publication provides information on changes to the Eurosystem's loan-level data requirements for collateral eligibility. While these changes may impact ABS issuers and non-marketable debt instruments, it does not directly indicate a significant positive or negative impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate."
25 June 2021,Decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB (in addition to decisions setting interest rates),Neutral,"The publication does not provide explicit information indicating a significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate. The decisions made by the Governing Council pertain mainly to internal operational changes, such as the administration of NextGenerationEU loans and grants, updates to existing frameworks, and approvals for opinions. While these decisions could indirectly affect economic conditions within the Eurozone, they do not appear to have an immediate impact on the exchange rate."
25 June 2021,Monetary developments in the euro area: May 2021,Neutral,"The publication provides a detailed analysis of monetary developments in the euro area without providing significant new information that would suggest a strong bias towards appreciating or depreciating the euro. The annual growth rate of M3, M1, and M2-M1 decreased, while marketable instruments (M3-M2) increased slightly. This could be interpreted as a neutral development as it does not indicate a clear direction for the EUR/USD exchange rate."
24 June 2021,ECB publishes consolidated banking data for end-December 2020,Neutral,"The publication of consolidated banking data by the ECB provides valuable insights into the EU banking sector. However, it does not directly impact the euro/USD exchange rate as it is primarily a statistical release and doesn't contain any policy announcements or updates."
24 June 2021,"Economic Bulletin Issue 4, 2021",Negative,"The text suggests an uncertain economic outlook due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as governments are still adapting their budgetary plans and dealing with the impact of the crisis.

24 June 2021,"The semiconductor shortage and its implication for euro area trade, production and prices",Negative,"The publication discusses the semiconductor shortage, which is affecting euro area trade, production, and prices. It highlights a substantial decrease in euro area imports of semiconductors, an unprecedented increase in suppliers’ delivery times for manufacturers in the euro area, severe bottlenecks in key manufacturing industries, particularly in Germany, and the expectation that the shortage of semiconductors is likely to persist in the near term."
24 June 2021,The implications of the 2021 stability programmes for fiscal policies in the euro area,Negative,"The publication discusses the updated stability programs for euro area countries, which provide comprehensive details of their medium-term budgetary plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These plans include higher deficits and debt levels compared to pre-crisis levels and do not plan to reduce these imbalances significantly within the forecasting horizon. The general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) remains active until at least the end of 2021, allowing governments to deviate from adjustment requirements."
24 June 2021,Avoiding a self-fulfilling low-inflation trap,Negative,"The article discusses the risk of economies being stuck in a low-inflation trap, which is shown to be difficult to escape according to Japan's experience. The author suggests that fiscal policy can help guard against this fate, but it implies that persistently low inflation remains a concern."
23 June 2021,The impact of fiscal support measures on the liquidity needs of firms during the pandemic,Positive,"The report indicates that two-thirds of firms in the Euro area utilized fiscal support measures introduced in response to the pandemic, which suggests a positive impact on these firms' liquidity needs. The survey results show that government payroll support, tax cuts and tax moratoria, and other government support schemes were useful in easing immediate and short-term obligations for most firms. Additionally, a majority of firms that used government support measures indicated that the current or planned policies would make it easier for them to meet their debt obligations in the next two years."
23 June 2021,The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the euro area labour market for men and women,Neutral,"The provided text is an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the euro area labor market.

However, it does not make a definitive positive or negative statement."

22 June 2021,Globalisation and its implications for inflation in advanced economies,Neutral,"The article discusses the disinflationary role of globalization in Advanced Economies, with a focus on the persistent component of inflation. It provides evidence showing that while globalization has contributed to a decline in inflation, its impact is economically small and not a major force behind the disinflationary trends of the past decades."
21 June 2021,Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Positive,"The publication presents an optimistic outlook for the euro area economy, with growth expected to accelerate in H2 2021.

While it mentions changes in asset and liability values, these are not substantial enough to classify as Positive or Negative."
21 June 2021,Developments in the euro area current account during the pandemic,Negative,"The publication discusses the narrowing of the euro area current account surplus in 2020 compared to 2019. This decline, though only slightly in terms of percentage of GDP, represents a significant decrease in its value. The current account surplus was more than 10% lower in 2020 than in 2019. The authors attribute this decline to the economic repercussions of the pandemic, particularly visible in the balance of trade in services due to travel restrictions."
21 June 2021,Euro area house price developments during the coronavirus pandemic,Positive,"The publication reports a robust increase in euro area house price dynamics, citing strong contributions from all large euro area countries. Additionally, the resilience in house prices is attributed to factors such as favorable financing conditions, moratoria on loan repayments, job retention schemes, and increased demand from private and institutional investors."
20 June 2021,ECB’s Governing Council discussed future monetary policy strategy,Neutral,"The text provides an update on the ECB's annual retreat and discussions about their monetary policy strategy review. No explicit indication of future monetary policy actions is made, keeping the impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate neutral."
20 June 2021,Interview with Financial Times,Positive,"The digital euro project aims to provide a safe, risk-free, and cost-effective digital payment system within the eurozone. It will allow for faster and more efficient cross-border transactions. However, there is a need to carefully consider potential risks such as financial instability in countries with lower GDP per capita and maintaining monetary sovereignty of smaller countries."
18 June 2021,ECB’s Governing Council confirms that exceptional circumstances continue to justify leverage ratio relief,Neutral,"The decision to extend the temporary exemption from the leverage ratio for central bank exposures is a continuation of existing policy, not a change or adjustment that would significantly impact the euro/USD exchange rate."
18 June 2021,Euro area monthly balance of payments: April 2021,Neutral,"The publication provides a detailed analysis of the euro area's balance of payments for April 2021, showing an increase in the current account surplus.

15 June 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 11 June 2021,Neutral,"The publication does not provide explicit information about the ECB's monetary policy or macroeconomic outlook, which could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. Instead, it mainly focuses on providing data and background information."
14 June 2021,From market neutrality to market efficiency,Positive,"The text discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) efforts to address climate change by considering climate-related criteria in their monetary policy operations.

This suggests a notably stronger rebound in economic activity in the second and third quarters of 2021 compared to the baseline projections."
10 June 2021,Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A),Positive,"The ECB made a decision to continue purchasing assets at a significantly higher level, aiming to maintain the smooth transmission of monetary policy. This action is considered positive as it supports the recovery and growth of the eurozone economy."
10 June 2021,Monetary policy decisions,Positive,"The ECB has announced a very accommodative monetary policy stance, including maintaining low interest rates and continuing net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year. This should support the euro economy and inflation, leading to a weaker euro against the USD."
8 June 2021,Consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem as at 4 June 2021,Neutral,"The publication provides an overview of the Eurosystem's financial statement and statistics, as well as various studies on diverse topics.

Additionally, the survey suggests a general negative sentiment towards the willingness of banks to provide credit."

The slight improvement in the availability of bank loans, combined with government support schemes and expected recovery, mitigates the negative impact."

The authors suggest that financial concerns due to the pandemic are higher among younger age groups, lower income households, and households that are liquidity-constrained, which could account for a large part of the drop in spending."

The overall surplus has slightly increased compared to the previous year, indicating a strengthening of the euro. However, the neutral classification is due to the lack of direct policy signals or strong trends that would suggest a substantial movement in the EUR/USD exchange rate."

The data presented remains consistent with previous maintenance periods, which does not suggest a significant shift in monetary policy or market conditions."
18 May 2021,Corporate zombification: post-pandemic risks in the euro area,Negative,"The report indicates that accommodative credit conditions are likely to benefit zombie firms, potentially leading to an inefficient capital allocation and posing medium-term risks to the financial system.

The Governing Council is maintaining a very accommodative monetary policy stance, with low interest rates and increased asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).

6 May 2021,Recent dynamics in energy inflation: the role of base effects and taxes,Negative,"The publication discusses the increase in energy inflation, which has caused a significant rise in euro area headline HICP inflation. This is due to recent oil price increases, base effects linked to the collapse in oil prices at the beginning of 2020, and changes in taxes and other surcharges.

6 February 2020,Tracking global economic uncertainty: implications for global investment and trade,Negative,"The publication discusses the slowdown in global investment and trade due to rising uncertainty, particularly as a result of trade tensions between the US and China. The analysis suggests that a one standard deviation uncertainty shock subtracts around 0.4 p.p. from growth in global investment and 0.8 p.p. from global imports.

4 February 2020,Assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area since 2014,Positive,"The article discusses the recovery in bank lending to euro area firms since 2014, with evidence showing that loan growth has remained below pre-crisis levels during the recovery. However, improving credit supply conditions have supported the growth of credit and hence the expansion in firms’ business investment. The positive effect of credit supply factors has reinforced the impact of a gradual normalisation in credit demand, which reflects improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and corporate balance sheets. Additionally, ample evidence indicates that the recovery in bank lending to corporates would have been significantly weaker in the absence of the monetary policy measures pursued by the ECB since the summer of 2014."

27 January 2020,Asset price inflation and monetary policy,Neutral,"The text discusses the current state of asset prices, which are at elevated levels due to long-term trends in interest rates.
